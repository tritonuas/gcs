// The RAW values of the RC channels sent to the MAV to override info received from the RC radio. The standard PPM modulation is as follows: 1000 microseconds: 0%, 2000 microseconds: 100%. Individual receivers/transmitters might violate this specification.  Note carefully the semantic differences between the first 8 channels and the subsequent channels
